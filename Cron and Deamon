Cron is the answer for this problem no doubt. The daemon would be needed if you have something that requires sub-minute wake up times or is completely event driven. If you have something that needs to run every 5 minutes you should schedule it with Cron and avoid all the daemon complexities. One thing that I would suggest looking into would to have a lock that will prevent the scripts from running more then one instance at a time.

crontab file Install a new crontab from file
crontab -l List your cron jobs
crontab -e Edit your cron jobs
crontab -r Remove all of your cron jobs

history displays commands that were used
$HISTSIZE = 1000
